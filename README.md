# OverridingMethods

Overriding in Java
In any object-oriented programming language, Overriding is a feature that allows a subclass or child class to
provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its super-classes or parent classes. 
When a method in a subclass has the same name, same parameters or signature and same return type(or sub-type) as a
method in its super-class, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the super-class.

In our Program .. the derived class Derived overide the method foo() from base class Base. So after instantiating Base class and calling
foo() function using object of base class function from derived will be called.
